<title>About the Venu database</title>
<body>
This site was basically created for two reasons:<br>
1. For learning PHP/MySQL/JavaScript/HTML and friends.<br>
2. To have a simple tool for sharing music reasources found online.<br>

<p>
There were possible solutions out there already of course but I couldn't find exactly what I wanted.
MediaWiki is too big and complicated for what I want, IMO.<br>
Sites like Sordo have a nice database already but I have no control over it and it could become unavailable at any time.<p>
<?php
echo "Server Name: ";
echo $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];
echo "<br>\n";
echo "Server Root: ";
echo $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];
